#專題摘要

隨著區塊鍊技術的迅速發展，資產代幣化逐漸成為革新各領域運作模式的
重要趨勢。不動產代幣化作為一種創新的資產管理模式，能將不動產資產分割
成可交易的數位代幣，不僅降低了投資門檻，更擴大了投資年齡層範圍。這項
技術的核心優勢在於提升資產流動性，使交易上更加透明、安全且可追溯。本
研究團隊將以台灣作為研究對象，深入探討現有市場上的不動產證券代幣化技
術，本研究將聚焦於技術可行性、市場潛力及法規環境等面向，全面性的評估
不動產代幣化在台灣市場的發展前景與可能性。

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
